A path traversal vulnerability exists in mlflow/mlflow version 2.9.2, allowing attackers to access arbitrary files on the server. By crafting a series of HTTP POST requests with specially crafted &#39;artifact_location&#39; and &#39;source&#39; parameters, using a local URI with &#39;#&#39; instead of &#39;?&#39;, an attacker can traverse the server&#39;s directory structure. The issue occurs due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in the server&#39;s handlers.
