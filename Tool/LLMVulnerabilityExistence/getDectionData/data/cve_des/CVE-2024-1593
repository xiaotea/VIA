A path traversal vulnerability exists in the mlflow/mlflow repository due to improper handling of URL parameters. By smuggling path traversal sequences using the &#39;;&#39; character in URLs, attackers can manipulate the &#39;params&#39; portion of the URL to gain unauthorized access to files or directories. This vulnerability allows for arbitrary data smuggling into the &#39;params&#39; part of the URL, enabling attacks similar to those described in previous reports but utilizing the &#39;;&#39; character for parameter smuggling. Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized information disclosure or server compromise.
