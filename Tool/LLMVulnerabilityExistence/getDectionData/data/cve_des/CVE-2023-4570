An improper access restriction in NI MeasurementLink Python services could allow an attacker on an adjacent network to reach services exposed on localhost.  These services were previously thought to be unreachable outside of the node.  This affects measurement plug-ins written in Python using version 1.1.0 of the ni-measurementlink-service Python package and all previous versions.
