MindsDB connects artificial intelligence models to real time data. Versions prior to 23.11.4.1 contain a server-side request forgery vulnerability in `file.py`. This can lead to limited information disclosure. Users should use MindsDB&#39;s `staging` branch or v23.11.4.1, which contain a fix for the issue.
