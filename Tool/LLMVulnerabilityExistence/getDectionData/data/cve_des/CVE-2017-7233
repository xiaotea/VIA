Django 1.10 before 1.10.7, 1.9 before 1.9.13, and 1.8 before 1.8.18 relies on user input in some cases to redirect the user to an &quot;on success&quot; URL. The security check for these redirects (namely ``django.utils.http.is_safe_url()``) considered some numeric URLs &quot;safe&quot; when they shouldn&#39;t be, aka an open redirect vulnerability. Also, if a developer relies on ``is_safe_url()`` to provide safe redirect targets and puts such a URL into a link, they could suffer from an XSS attack.
