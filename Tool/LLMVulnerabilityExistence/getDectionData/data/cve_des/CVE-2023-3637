An uncontrolled resource consumption flaw was found in openstack-neutron. This flaw allows a remote authenticated user to query a list of security groups for an invalid project. This issue creates resources that are unconstrained by the user&#39;s quota. If a malicious user were to submit a significant number of requests, this could lead to a denial of service.
