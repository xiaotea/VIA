TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.12.0 and 2.11.1, integer overflow occurs when `2^31 &lt;= num_frames * height * width * channels &lt; 2^32`, for example Full HD screencast of at least 346 frames. A fix is included in TensorFlow version 2.12.0 and version 2.11.1.
