Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition vulnerability in Apache StreamPipes in user self-registration.
This allows an attacker to potentially request the creation of multiple accounts with the same email address until the email address is registered, creating many identical users and corrupting StreamPipe&#39;s user management.
This issue affects Apache StreamPipes: through 0.93.0.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 0.95.0, which fixes the issue.
