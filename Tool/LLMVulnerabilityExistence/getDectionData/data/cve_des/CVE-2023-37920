Certifi is a curated collection of Root Certificates for validating the trustworthiness of SSL certificates while verifying the identity of TLS hosts. Certifi prior to version 2023.07.22 recognizes &quot;e-Tugra&quot; root certificates. e-Tugra&#39;s root certificates were subject to an investigation prompted by reporting of security issues in their systems. Certifi 2023.07.22 removes root certificates from &quot;e-Tugra&quot; from the root store.
