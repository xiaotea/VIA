A path traversal vulnerability was identified in the parisneo/lollms-webui repository, specifically within version 9.6. The vulnerability arises due to improper handling of user-supplied input in the &#39;list_personalities&#39; endpoint. By crafting a malicious HTTP request, an attacker can traverse the directory structure and view the contents of any folder, albeit limited to subfolder names only. This issue was demonstrated via a specific HTTP request that manipulated the &#39;category&#39; parameter to access arbitrary directories. The vulnerability is present in the code located at the &#39;endpoints/lollms_advanced.py&#39; file.
