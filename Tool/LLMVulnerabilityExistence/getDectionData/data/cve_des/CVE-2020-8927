A buffer overflow exists in the Brotli library versions prior to 1.0.8 where an attacker controlling the input length of a &quot;one-shot&quot; decompression request to a script can trigger a crash, which happens when copying over chunks of data larger than 2 GiB. It is recommended to update your Brotli library to 1.0.8 or later. If one cannot update, we recommend to use the &quot;streaming&quot; API as opposed to the &quot;one-shot&quot; API, and impose chunk size limits.
