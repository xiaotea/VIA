Apache Airflow, versions 2.7.0 and 2.7.1, is affected by a vulnerability that allows an authenticated user to retrieve sensitive configuration information when the &quot;expose_config&quot; option is set to &quot;non-sensitive-only&quot;. The `expose_config` option is False by default.
It is recommended to upgrade to a version that is not affected.
