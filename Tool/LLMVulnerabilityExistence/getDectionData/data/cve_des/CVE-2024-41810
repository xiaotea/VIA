Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications, supporting Python 3.6+. The `twisted.web.util.redirectTo` function contains an HTML injection vulnerability. If application code allows an attacker to control the redirect URL this vulnerability may result in Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the redirect response HTML body. This vulnerability is fixed in 24.7.0rc1.
