AccessControl provides a general security framework for use in Zope. Python&#39;s &quot;format&quot; functionality allows someone controlling the format string to &quot;read&quot; objects accessible (recursively) via attribute access and subscription from accessible objects. Those attribute accesses and subscriptions use Python&#39;s full blown `getattr` and `getitem`, not the policy restricted `AccessControl` variants `_getattr_` and `_getitem_`. This can lead to critical information disclosure. `AccessControl` already provides a safe variant for `str.format` and denies access to `string.Formatter`. However, `str.format_map` is still unsafe. Affected are all users who allow untrusted users to create `AccessControl` controlled Python code and execute it. A fix has been introduced in versions 4.4, 5.8 and 6.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
