Docassemble is an expert system for guided interviews and document assembly. Prior to 1.4.97, a user could type HTML into a field, including the field for the user&#39;s name, and then that HTML could be displayed on the screen as HTML. The vulnerability has been patched in version 1.4.97 of the master branch.
