Certifi is a curated collection of Root Certificates for validating the trustworthiness of SSL certificates while verifying the identity of TLS hosts. Certifi 2022.12.07 removes root certificates from &quot;TrustCor&quot; from the root store. These are in the process of being removed from Mozilla&#39;s trust store. TrustCor&#39;s root certificates are being removed pursuant to an investigation prompted by media reporting that TrustCor&#39;s ownership also operated a business that produced spyware. Conclusions of Mozilla&#39;s investigation can be found in the linked google group discussion.
