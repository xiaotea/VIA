A vulnerability in significant-gravitas/autogpt version 0.5.1 allows an attacker to bypass the shell commands denylist settings. The issue arises when the denylist is configured to block specific commands, such as &#39;whoami&#39; and &#39;/bin/whoami&#39;. An attacker can circumvent this restriction by executing commands with a modified path, such as &#39;/bin/./whoami&#39;, which is not recognized by the denylist.
