vanna-ai/vanna version v0.3.4 is vulnerable to SQL injection in some file-critical functions such as `pg_read_file()`. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote users to read arbitrary local files on the victim server, including sensitive files like `/etc/passwd`, by exploiting the exposed SQL queries via a Python Flask API.
