OctoPrint provides a web interface for controlling consumer 3D printers. OctoPrint versions up until and including 1.10.2 contain a vulnerability that allows an attacker that has gained temporary control over an authenticated victim&#39;s OctoPrint browser session to retrieve/recreate/delete the user&#39;s or - if the victim has admin permissions - the global API key without having to reauthenticate by re-entering the user account&#39;s password. An attacker could use a stolen API key to access OctoPrint through its API, or disrupt workflows depending on the API key they deleted. This vulnerability will be patched in version 1.10.3 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
