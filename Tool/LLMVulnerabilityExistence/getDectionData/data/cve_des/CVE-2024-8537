A path traversal vulnerability exists in the modelscope/agentscope application, affecting all versions. The vulnerability is present in the /delete-workflow endpoint, allowing an attacker to delete arbitrary files from the filesystem. This issue arises due to improper input validation, enabling the attacker to manipulate file paths and delete sensitive files outside of the intended directory.
