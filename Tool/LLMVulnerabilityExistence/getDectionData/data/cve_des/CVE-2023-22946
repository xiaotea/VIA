In Apache Spark versions prior to 3.4.0, applications using spark-submit can specify a &#39;proxy-user&#39; to run as, limiting privileges. The application can execute code with the privileges of the submitting user, however, by providing malicious configuration-related classes on the classpath. This affects architectures relying on proxy-user, for example those using Apache Livy to manage submitted applications.

Update to Apache Spark 3.4.0 or later, and ensure that 
spark.submit.proxyUser.allowCustomClasspathInClusterMode is set to its 
default of &quot;false&quot;, and is not overridden by submitted applications.
