In Red Discord Bot before version 3.3.11, a RCE exploit has been discovered in the Trivia module: this exploit allows Discord users with specifically crafted usernames to inject code into the Trivia module&#39;s leaderboard command. By abusing this exploit, it&#39;s possible to perform destructive actions and/or access sensitive information. This critical exploit has been fixed on version 3.3.11.
