In the marshmallow library before 2.15.1 and 3.x before 3.0.0b9 for Python, the schema &quot;only&quot; option treats an empty list as implying no &quot;only&quot; option, which allows a request that was intended to expose no fields to instead expose all fields (if the schema is being filtered dynamically using the &quot;only&quot; option, and there is a user role that produces an empty value for &quot;only&quot;).
