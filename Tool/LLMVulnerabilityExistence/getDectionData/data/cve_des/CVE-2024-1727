A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in gradio-app/gradio allows attackers to upload multiple large files to a victim&#39;s system if they are running Gradio locally. By crafting a malicious HTML page that triggers an unauthorized file upload to the victim&#39;s server, an attacker can deplete the system&#39;s disk space, potentially leading to a denial of service. This issue affects the file upload functionality as implemented in gradio/routes.py.
