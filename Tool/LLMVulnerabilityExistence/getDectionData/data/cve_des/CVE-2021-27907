Apache Superset up to and including 0.38.0 allowed the creation of a Markdown component on a Dashboard page for describing chart&#39;s related information. Abusing this functionality, a malicious user could inject javascript code executing unwanted action in the context of the user&#39;s browser. The javascript code will be automatically executed (Stored XSS) when a legitimate user surfs on the dashboard page. The vulnerability is exploitable creating a “div” section and embedding in it a “svg” element with javascript code.
