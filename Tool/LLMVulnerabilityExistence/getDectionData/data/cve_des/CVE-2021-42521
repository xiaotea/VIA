There is a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in VTK before 9.2.5, and it lies in IO/Infovis/vtkXMLTreeReader.cxx. The vendor didn&#39;t check the return value of libxml2 API &#39;xmlDocGetRootElement&#39;, and try to dereference it. It is unsafe as the return value can be NULL and that NULL pointer dereference may crash the application.
