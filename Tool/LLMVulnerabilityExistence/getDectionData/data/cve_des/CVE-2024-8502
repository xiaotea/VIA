A vulnerability in the RpcAgentServerLauncher class of modelscope/agentscope v0.0.6a3 allows for remote code execution (RCE) via deserialization of untrusted data using the dill library. The issue occurs in the AgentServerServicer.create_agent method, where serialized input is deserialized using dill.loads, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
