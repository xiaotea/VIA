When installing a package from a Mercurial VCS URL  (ie &quot;pip install 
hg+...&quot;) with pip prior to v23.3, the specified Mercurial revision could
 be used to inject arbitrary configuration options to the &quot;hg clone&quot; 
call (ie &quot;--config&quot;). Controlling the Mercurial configuration can modify
 how and which repository is installed. This vulnerability does not 
affect users who aren&#39;t installing from Mercurial.
