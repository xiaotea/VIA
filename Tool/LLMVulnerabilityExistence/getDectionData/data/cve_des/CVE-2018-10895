qutebrowser before version 1.4.1 is vulnerable to a cross-site request forgery flaw that allows websites to access &#39;qute://*&#39; URLs. A malicious website could exploit this to load a &#39;qute://settings/set&#39; URL, which then sets &#39;editor.command&#39; to a bash script, resulting in arbitrary code execution.
