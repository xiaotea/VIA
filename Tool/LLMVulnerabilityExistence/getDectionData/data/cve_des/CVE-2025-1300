CodeChecker is an analyzer tooling, defect database and viewer extension for the Clang Static Analyzer and Clang Tidy. 

The CodeChecker web server contains an open redirect vulnerability due to missing protections against multiple slashes after the product name in the URL. This results in bypassing the protections against CVE-2021-28861, leading to the same open redirect pathway.

This issue affects CodeChecker: through 6.24.5.
