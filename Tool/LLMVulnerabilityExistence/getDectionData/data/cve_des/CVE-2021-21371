Tenable for Jira Cloud is an open source project designed to pull Tenable.io vulnerability data, then generate Jira Tasks and sub-tasks based on the vulnerabilities&#39; current state. It published in pypi as &quot;tenable-jira-cloud&quot;. In tenable-jira-cloud before version 1.1.21, it is possible to run arbitrary commands through the yaml.load() method. This could allow an attacker with local access to the host to run arbitrary code by running the application with a specially crafted YAML configuration file. This is fixed in version 1.1.21 by using yaml.safe_load() instead of yaml.load().
