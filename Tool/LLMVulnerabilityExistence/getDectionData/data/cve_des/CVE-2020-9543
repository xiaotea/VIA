OpenStack Manila &lt;7.4.1, &gt;=8.0.0 &lt;8.1.1, and &gt;=9.0.0 &lt;9.1.1 allows attackers to view, update, delete, or share resources that do not belong to them, because of a context-free lookup of a UUID. Attackers may also create resources, such as shared file systems and groups of shares on such share networks.
