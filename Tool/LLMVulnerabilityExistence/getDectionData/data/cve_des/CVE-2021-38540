The variable import endpoint was not protected by authentication in Airflow &gt;=2.0.0, &lt;2.1.3. This allowed unauthenticated users to hit that endpoint to add/modify Airflow variables used in DAGs, potentially resulting in a denial of service, information disclosure or remote code execution. This issue affects Apache Airflow &gt;=2.0.0, &lt;2.1.3.
