A path traversal vulnerability exists in the mlflow/mlflow repository, specifically within the handling of the `artifact_location` parameter when creating an experiment. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by using a fragment component `#` in the artifact location URI to read arbitrary files on the server in the context of the server&#39;s process. This issue is similar to CVE-2023-6909 but utilizes a different component of the URI to achieve the same effect.
