In Django 1.10.x before 1.10.8 and 1.11.x before 1.11.5, HTML autoescaping was disabled in a portion of the template for the technical 500 debug page. Given the right circumstances, this allowed a cross-site scripting attack. This vulnerability shouldn&#39;t affect most production sites since you shouldn&#39;t run with &quot;DEBUG = True&quot; (which makes this page accessible) in your production settings.
