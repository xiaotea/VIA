An SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) vulnerability exists in the gradio-app/gradio repository, allowing attackers to scan and identify open ports within an internal network. By manipulating the &#39;file&#39; parameter in a GET request, an attacker can discern the status of internal ports based on the presence of a &#39;Location&#39; header or a &#39;File not allowed&#39; error in the response.
