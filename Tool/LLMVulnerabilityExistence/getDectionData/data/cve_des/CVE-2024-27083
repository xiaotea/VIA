Flask-AppBuilder is an application development framework, built on top of Flask. A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been discovered on the OAuth login page. An attacker could trick a user to follow a specially crafted URL to the OAuth login page. This URL could inject and execute malicious javascript code that would get executed on the user&#39;s browser. This issue was introduced on 4.1.4 and patched on 4.2.1.
