A vulnerability in the dataframe component of gradio-app/gradio (version git 98cbcae) allows for a zip bomb attack. The component uses pd.read_csv to process input values, which can accept compressed files. An attacker can exploit this by uploading a maliciously crafted zip bomb, leading to a server crash and causing a denial of service.
