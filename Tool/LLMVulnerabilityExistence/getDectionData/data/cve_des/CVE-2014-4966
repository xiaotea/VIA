Ansible before 1.6.7 does not prevent inventory data with &quot;{{&quot; and &quot;lookup&quot; substrings, and does not prevent remote data with &quot;{{&quot; substrings, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) crafted lookup(&#39;pipe&#39;) calls or (2) crafted Jinja2 data.
