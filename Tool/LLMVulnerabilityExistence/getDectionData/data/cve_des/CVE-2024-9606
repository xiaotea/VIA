In berriai/litellm before version 1.44.12, the `litellm/litellm_core_utils/litellm_logging.py` file contains a vulnerability where the API key masking code only masks the first 5 characters of the key. This results in the leakage of almost the entire API key in the logs, exposing a significant amount of the secret key. The issue affects version v1.44.9.
