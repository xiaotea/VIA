Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability in Apache DolphinScheduler.

The information exposed to unauthorized actors may include sensitive data such as database credentials.

Users who can&#39;t upgrade to the fixed version can also set environment variable `MANAGEMENT_ENDPOINTS_WEB_EXPOSURE_INCLUDE=health,metrics,prometheus` to workaround this, or add the following section in the `application.yaml` file

```
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: health,metrics,prometheus
```

This issue affects Apache DolphinScheduler: from 3.0.0 before 3.0.2.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.0.2, which fixes the issue.
