Werkzeug is a Web Server Gateway Interface web application library. On Python &lt; 3.11 on Windows, os.path.isabs() does not catch UNC paths like //server/share. Werkzeug&#39;s safe_join() relies on this check, and so can produce a path that is not safe, potentially allowing unintended access to data. Applications using Python &gt;= 3.11, or not using Windows, are not vulnerable. Werkzeug version 3.0.6 contains a patch.
