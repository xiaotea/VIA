In the latest version (20240628) of gaizhenbiao/chuanhuchatgpt, an issue exists in the /file endpoint that allows authenticated users to access the chat history of other users. When a user logs in, a directory is created in the history folder with the user&#39;s name. By manipulating the /file endpoint, an authenticated user can enumerate and access files in other users&#39; directories, leading to unauthorized access to private chat histories. This vulnerability can be exploited to read any user&#39;s private chat history.
