The ops library is a Python framework for developing and testing Kubernetes and machine charms. The issue here is that ops passes the secret content as one of the args via CLI. This issue may affect any of the charms that are using: Juju (&gt;=3.0), Juju secrets and not correctly capturing and processing `subprocess.CalledProcessError`. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.15.0.
